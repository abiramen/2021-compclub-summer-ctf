its late and im awake
staring at the wall
open up my window
head floats out the door
no one else around
the shimmer takes my eye
i lift my head
blinded by the sky
feel my weight in front
following the sound
moves away so fast
fall down to the ground
i know theres more to come
jump back to my feet
now i only see ahead of me
chasing down the street
gave my love to a shooting star
but she moves so fast
that i cant keep up
im chasing
im in love with a shooting star
but she moves so fast
when she falls then
ill be waiting
gave my love to a shooting star
but she moves so fast
that i cant keep up
im chasing
im in love with a shooting star
but she moves so fast
when she falls then
ill be waiting
gave my love to a shooting star
but she moves so fast
that i cant keep up
im chasing
im in love with a shooting star
but she moves so fast
when she falls then
ill be waiting

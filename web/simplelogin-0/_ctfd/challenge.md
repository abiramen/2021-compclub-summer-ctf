When I grow up, I want to be a software developer at NASA. I'm still on my way to getting there. I decided to practice my web development skills and make an unbreakable login site. I bet you can't hack me - I'll even tell you that my username is `spaceman`.

Good luck!

Note: There are three flags that can be found at the above link. The flag you enter here starts with `FLAG{0`. The other two flags go in simplelogin-1 or simplelogin-2. 

Flag 0 has three parts to it - you'll have to find each part (labelled 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3) and join them together to get the full flag!

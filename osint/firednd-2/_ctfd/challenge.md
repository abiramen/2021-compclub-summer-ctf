No way, it's me, the CEO of [FireDnD](https://firednd-syd.web.app) again!

My fired frontend developer hid a secret webpage on our website. I found out about this cool way to prevent search engines from finding the page, so I used that to prevent the page from showing up. I also replaced the contents of the page. Surely no-one can find it now, right?

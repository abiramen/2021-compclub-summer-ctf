CEO of [FireDnD](https://firednd-syd.web.app) here to give you one last task!

We found out our fired developer was working with his partner in order to embezzle money from our company. We figured out a lot about her, but we haven't been able to figure out her middle name.

Would you be able to do some hunting on the internet for it? Thanks.

Note: Remember to wrap your answer in `FLAG{}`!

CEO of FireDnD here again!

Quite recently, I had to fire my frontend web developer, because they were doing a terrible job, as you can probably tell from our [incomplete website](https://firednd.web.app). I'm still in the process of removing all traces of him from our current website. Your first task is to find a picture of our fired frontend team member, hidden somewhere on our website.

Good luck!

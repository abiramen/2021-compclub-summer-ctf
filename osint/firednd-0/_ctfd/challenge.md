Hello! CEO of FireDnD here! We're a small startup that aims to connect people together for games of Dungeons and Dragons. [You can check out our (incomplete - more on that later) website here!](https://firednd-syd.web.app)

I've got a few tasks for you to complete, but before we start, could you do me a favour?

I'm supposed to meet up with someone after work today. I finish at 5PM, and take 8 minutes to walk from my office to Platform 2 of the nearest\* station. I then need to catch the next T4 train, before I get off at the second stop. Can you figure out what time I get off the train?

Your answer should be a 24-hour time. For example, if your answer is 6:04PM, enter `FLAG{1804}`.

\* Nearest by straight-line distance. The location of a station can be determined by the position of the 'T' logo on Google Maps.
